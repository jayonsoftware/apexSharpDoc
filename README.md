# ApexSharp

ApexSharp allows you to write Salesforce applicaitons in C# and then automaitcally convert them to APEX. Its a Two Way [Transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler). 

By writing your APEX code in C#, you take advantage of localdevelopment plus all the advance tools that C# developers are used to. I find this way of developing is 5 to 10 times more productive then developing APEX code directly on SalesForce.
