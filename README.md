C# to APEX converter and a APEX to C# converter

ApexSharp is C# library that allows you to write Salesforce APEX code in C# and then automatically convert them to APEX code, a . Itâ€™s a [Transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) like TypeScript but convert code both ways.  

By writing your APEX code in C#, you take advantage of local development plus all the advance tools that C# developers are used to. I find this way of developing is 5 to 10 times more productive then developing APEX code directly on Salesforce.
